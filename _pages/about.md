Hey there! I'm a final-year student at IIT Roorkee, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I passionately follow the developments in the fields of computer science with potential real world impacts, particularly interested in deep learning. 

As a member of the Vision and Language Group at IIT Roorkee, I actively participate in weekly discussions on the latest research in deep learning. I enjoy exploring the latest advances in the rapidly advancing field of deep learning, with a focus on how these techniques can be applied to financial markets.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
